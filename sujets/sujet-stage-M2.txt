We propose in this internship to formalise in Coq [1] several key results of partial order theory: fixpoint theorems [2] and Galois connections [2,3]. These results are useful in numerous domains of computer science: semantics, logic, abstract interpretation, optimisation, algorithmics. Simplified and specialised versions of these results have sometimes been formalised for the need of concrete projects. But a reference general-purpose library on those concepts is still missing, that would contain once and for all the key theorems under their most general form, in order to enable their reuse within many contexts. We shall follow the presentation of [2, chapters 7 and 8]. In addition to the inherent complexity of some theorems, a challenge consists in finding how to organise the library in a modular way, to deal uniformly with properties of partial orders with more or less structure (lattices, distributive lattices, complete lattices, cpos, pointed cpos, etc). In order to test the library, we will use it to factor the code of certain existing libraries for which ad-hoc formalisations of partial order theory had been required [4,5].
