  abstract = {This book is intended as a basic text for a one-year course in Algebra at the graduate level, or as a useful reference for mathematicians and professionals who use higher-level algebra. It successfully addresses the basic concepts of algebra. For the revised third edition, the author has added exercises and made numerous corrections to the text. Comments on Serge Lang's Algebra: Lang's Algebra changed the way graduate algebra is taught, retaining classical topics but introducing language and ways of thinking from category theory and homological algebra. It has affected all subsequent graduate-level algebra books. April 1999 Notices of the AMS, announcing that the author was awarded the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition for his many mathematics books. The author has an impressive knack for presenting the important and interesting ideas of algebra in just the "right" way, and he never gets bogged down in the dry formalism which pervades some parts of algebra.

abstract="What are the real numbers? At least the question has become somewhat clearer since it was posed in Section 1: any satisfactory answer must provide a frame of reference for mathematical activity, in particular for proving theorems in analysis. There seem to be two aspects of this activity that go hand in hand: on the one hand there is what active mathematicians call ``intuition'' (without, if they are wise, going into its psychological details), or ``thinking in concepts'', on the other the mathematical formalism which, with the help of symbolic logic, can be refined into a precision tool.",
